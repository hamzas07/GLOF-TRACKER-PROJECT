# 🌊 GLOF Tracker – Glacial Lake Outburst Flood Early Warning System

## 📌 Overview

**GLOF Tracker** is a data-driven Early Warning System designed to assess and visualize the risk of **Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs)**. The platform combines geospatial data, machine learning models, and a full-stack web application to provide actionable insights for disaster preparedness, awareness, and decision-making.

The project focuses on **software-only intelligence** (no IoT dependency), making it scalable, cost-effective, and deployable across regions.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Glacial Lake Outburst Floods are sudden and catastrophic events caused by the failure of natural dams holding glacial lakes. Existing systems are often:

* Reactive rather than predictive
* Hardware-dependent and expensive
* Difficult to visualize for non-technical stakeholders

**GLOF Tracker** addresses these gaps by providing a **predictive, visual, and accessible web-based solution**.
